# AccessHorizonsV0

15% of the worldâ€™s population is disabled and 8.7% is over 65 years old. People with disabilities often encounter difficulties during their travels, whether professional or touristic.

Our project aims to develop a mobile application for people with disabilities, to enable them to understand the accessibility of places (eg hotels, restaurants, shops and places of transport).

We have developed our application using the Ionic Framework to export it to Android, iOS and Windows Phone systems. We use the database of Jaccede on the one hand to get detailed information and comments on different institutions around the world. In addition, we allow users of our application to complete our database, based on the criteria of Jaccede. We take into account a system of notation according to certain criteria, following the exchanges that we could have with the APRIDEV association.

We made sure to take into account that our application should be accessible from the design stage, which is an advantage over other existing services.
