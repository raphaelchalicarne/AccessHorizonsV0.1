# AccessHorizonsV0

15% of the worldâ€™s population is disabled and 8.7% is over 65 years old. People with di-sabilities often encounter difficulties during their travels, whether professional or touristic.

Our project aims to develop a mobile application for people with disabilities, to en-able them to predict the accessibility of places (eg hotels, restaurants, shops and placesof transport).

We have developed our application using the Ionic Framework to export it to Android,iOS and Windows Phone systems. We use the database of Jaccede on the one hand to getdetailed information and comments on different institutions around the world. In addi-tion, we allow users of our application to complete our database, based on the criteria ofJaccede. We take into account a system of notation according to certain criteria, followingthe exchanges that we could have with the APRIDEV association.

We made sure to take into account that our application should be accessible from thedesign stage, which is an advantage over other existing services.
